"""
Command Registry for Dynamic Security Profiles
==============================================

FACADE MODULE: This module re-exports all functionality from the
xaheen/project/command_registry/ package for backward compatibility.

The implementation has been refactored into focused modules:
- command_registry/base.py - Core commands and validated commands
- command_registry/languages.py - Language-specific commands
- command_registry/package_managers.py - Package manager commands
- command_registry/frameworks.py - Framework-specific commands
- command_registry/databases.py - Database commands
- command_registry/infrastructure.py - Infrastructure/DevOps commands
- command_registry/cloud.py - Cloud provider commands
- command_registry/code_quality.py - Code quality tools
- command_registry/version_managers.py - Version management tools

This file maintains the original API so existing imports continue to work.

Maps technologies to their associated commands for building
tailored security profiles.
