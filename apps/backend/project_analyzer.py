"""
Smart Project Analyzer for Dynamic Security Profiles
=====================================================

FACADE MODULE: This module re-exports all functionality from the
xaheen/project/ package for backward compatibility.

The implementation has been refactored into focused modules:
- project/command_registry.py - Command registries
- project/models.py - Data structures
- project/config_parser.py - Config file parsing
- project/stack_detector.py - Stack detection
- project/framework_detector.py - Framework detection
- project/structure_analyzer.py - Project structure analysis
- project/analyzer.py - Main orchestration

This file maintains the original API so existing imports continue to work.

This system:
1. Detects languages, frameworks, databases, and infrastructure
2. Parses package.json scripts, Makefile targets, pyproject.toml scripts
3. Builds a tailored security profile for the specific project
4. Caches the profile for subsequent runs
5. Can re-analyze when project structure changes

The goal: Allow an AI developer to run any command that's legitimately
needed for the detected tech stack, while blocking dangerous operations.
